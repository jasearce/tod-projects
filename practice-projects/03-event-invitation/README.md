# Project 3: Event Invitation Page

## Description 

The main goal of this repo is to design a static page for a fictional event, like a birthday party or a book club meeting. This will let you experiment with Flexbox for layout and alignment in a creative way.

## Guidance

### HTML Structure

  - Add a `<header>` with the event name (e.g., "Spring Book Club").
  - Use a `<main>` section with event details: date, time, location, and a short description.
  - Include a `<footer>` with an RSVP note or fake organizer contact.


### Flexbox Styling

  - In the `<header>`, use Flexbox to center the event name or align it with a small subtitle.
  - For the `<main>` section, create a flex container to arrange the event details in a column or row. For example, stack "Date," "Time," and "Location" vertically with `flex-direction: column`, and place the description beside or below it.
  - Use Flexbox properties like `align-items` and `justify-content` to center the content or distribute it evenly.
  - Style the `<footer>` as a flex container to align the RSVP info neatly.
