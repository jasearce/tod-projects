# Project 2: Recipe Card Collection

## Description

The main goal of this repo is to build a webpage that displays a collection of recipe cards (e.g., 3–4 recipes). This will help you practice nesting Flexbox containers and organizing content visually.

## Guidance:

For guidance this project follows these instructions:

### TML Structure:
- Create a `<header>` with a title like "My Favorite Recipes."
- Use a `<main>` section to hold a container for your recipe cards.
- Each recipe card should be a `<div>` with a title (e.g., "Pasta"), a short description, and a list of ingredients.


### Flexbox Styling:
- Style the container in `<main>` as a flex container with flex-direction: row to display the recipe cards side by side.
- Use flex-wrap: wrap if you want to experiment with how cards behave when there’s not enough space (though keep it static for now).
- Inside each card, make it a flex container with flex-direction: column to stack the title, description, and ingredients vertically.
- Play with gap, padding, and margin to space things out nicely, and add borders or background colors to make the cards stand out.
